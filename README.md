# consul-setup

A repository that bundles different setups for running consul clusters.

# How to start

This project expects you to have `docker-compose` installed on your system.

For the best experience, you probably want to have [volta](https://volta.sh/) installed.

1. `yarn`
2. `???`
3. `Profit`

## Seriously, what do I do?

You can find the different setups in the `setups`-folder. You clone this
repository, switch to the folder of the setup you wish to start and follow the
instructions in the respective README.
